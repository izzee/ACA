        <p>CHABON ARCHITECTS was founded in 1999.  The firm specializes in high-end residential architecture and fine institutional/commercial projects throughout the United States and the Bahamas.  We have proudly collaborated with the greatest interior decorators in the world including Rose Tarlow, Jacques Grange, Ellie Cullman, Thierry Despont, and Mica Ertegun. Our work is based on the principle that architecture must evoke a strong sense of permanence. Therefore, its form must not be generated arbitrarily; rather, it must be derived from its architectural, historical, and social context with our clientsâ€™ visions and aspirations guiding our way. Ultimately, that form serves as the means by which space, volume, and composition are perfected. For Chabon Architects design is the process of discovering the inherent reality of what does not yet exist.</p>
